            <p>Kana Match is a place where you can test your knowledge of the Japanese kana alphabet. I created this project as a way to practice building a Vue.js app. A work in progress. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/robinnong/robin-nong-beyond-bootcamp">GitHub repository</a> or send me suggestions for features! I'm always looking for user feedback ðŸ‘‹</p>
