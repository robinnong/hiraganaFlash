## Features
- Learning with a Hiragana chart displaying different sounds and equivalent english (romaji) pronounciation

- Project as an exercise for using ES6 modules and bundling with Webpack

### To Do
- Responsiveness
- Accessibility audit
- Incorporate Katakana charts
- Add a Kanji learning section and calls to an API to receive kanji information

### Improvements from Vanilla JS to Vue
- Discontinued Drag and Drop feature in quiz and implemented "Tap to Match" feature for improved accessibility. 
- Switch from manipulating the DOM with vanilla js query selectors and storing all DOM changes in the Vue object's state.
